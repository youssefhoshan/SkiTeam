# Skiteam Hoofddorp Ski Race Organizer App

Welcome to the Skiteam Hoofddorp Ski Race Organizer App! This README will guide you through the steps to set up and use the app on your local development environment.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To start using the app, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/opdracht_ski.git
```

Make sure to replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Import the Database

Inside the repository, you will find a database file (e.g., `skiteam.sql`). Import this SQL file into your own database management system (e.g., MySQL, phpMyAdmin) to create the necessary database tables and structure.

### 3. Set Up XAMPP

If you haven't already, download and install XAMPP, a popular web development environment, which includes Apache and MySQL. You can download XAMPP from [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) based on your operating system.

### 4. Move the App to XAMPP `htdocs`

Locate the directory where you installed XAMPP and navigate to the `htdocs` folder. Move the entire `opdracht_ski` folder (the one you cloned from this repository) into the `htdocs` folder.

### 5. Start XAMPP and Apache

Launch XAMPP and start the Apache web server by clicking the "Start" button next to Apache in the XAMPP Control Panel.

### 6. Access the App

Open your web browser and type the following URL into the address bar:

```
http://localhost/opdracht_ski/
```

This will take you to the Skiteam Hoofddorp Ski Race Organizer App running on your local development environment.

## Using the App

Once you have accessed the app, you can use it to organize ski races as described in the project requirements. Follow the app's user interface to create racers, races, record times, and calculate race results based on the selected competition format.

## Additional Configuration

If you encounter any issues or need further configuration instructions, please refer to the app's documentation or check the error logs for more details.
